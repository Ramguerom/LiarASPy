                       <h5>Piano classes</h5>
                       <br>
                        <p>Our piano lessons are 1 hour long, from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. from Monday to Friday. On Saturdays, in the same way if they teach from 10:00 until 14:00.
                        <img src="imagenes/clasePiano.jpg" align="right">
                        These classes are adapted for any level, whether you are a beginner, medium or advanced. Our teachers will know the level and potential you have and will put pieces that are at your level or a little higher, so that you can strive and increase your level. In the same way, the teachers will see the problems you have when playing, putting on works that require that technique so that you perfect it and do not have that problem.
                        <br>
                        You have different classes so don't worry there will always be a class with the time that is best available for you.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Harmony classes and analysis</h5>
                        <br>
                        <p>Our harmony and analysis classes are taught to students who already have advanced intellectual maturity, because these classes are more abstract and therefore more difficult to understand.
                        <img src="imagenes/armoniaClase.jpg" align="left">
                        In the same way as piano lessons, these are also divided into levels, but in this case in two each, since analysis is the continuation of harmony but focused on one of the three parts that has harmony.
                        <br>
                        These classes as they are collective classes have a predetermined schedule depending on the group to which they belong, however if there is any problem we will consider the option of putting you in another class and that they give you the corresponding level.

                        <h5>Music history classes</h5>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        <img src="imagenes/hdlmClase.jpg" align="right">We teach our history of music at any level, since it seems very important to us that, just as we have a passion for music, we need to know when it exists and how it originated.
                        <br>
                        In this subject we also comment on many other composers who are not as renowned, but are also very important for music, these composers will not only be piano but all instruments. In this way, you may discover that there is another instrument that you like as much as the piano.

                        <h5>Theory and singing classes</h5>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        <img src="imagenes/coroClase.jpg" align="left">The chorus classes are divided into two levels. The first for the smallest, since these have not yet changed their voice and their register is broader and more moldable. The second is for the older ones. In this group the choir will already be divided into different scores, since we will have a greater variety of voices.
                        <br>
                        These choirs are usually accompanied by pianists, so students who like and have the required level for these works will be able to play with the choir!
